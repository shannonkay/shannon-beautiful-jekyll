I finished reading My Contrary Mary today, and it did not disappoint. More of a review of the book will be coming soon. Life and kids got in the way of my finishing it sooner, but I was excited to finish reading My Contrary Mary on my new Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition. 

The Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition is a nice upgrade from my older Kindle Paperwhite. Some points of improvement: 
	‚Ä¢	Modern charging standards, with a USB-C port and wireless charging
	‚Ä¢	No ads!
	‚Ä¢	The option to show my current book cover on the ad-free screen when it‚Äôs locked
	‚Ä¢	A flush screen, not a screen that‚Äôs lower than the bezel (as on my previous Kindle)
	‚Ä¢	Faster loading, and better responsiveness
	‚Ä¢	Nice case that automatically locks and unlocks when I open and close it. (Wireless charging works through the case too!)
	‚Ä¢	Audible support with bluetooth for headphones (though I haven‚Äôt tried this yet).

Overall, this Kindle is definitely worth upgrading to.

My Contrary Mary (Review)



‚ÄúThis was before coffee, dear readers. Although our research did reveal that in the ninth century, an Ethiopian goatherd named Kaldi noticed how excited his goats became after eating the beans from a coffee plant. So, really, it was before coffee was available in France, which we think is inhumane. ‚Äú

My Contrary Mary was a delightful expansion of the Lady Janies series to include Mary. The book is wonderfully funny with its combination of historical fact, fiction, and humorous commentary. I particularly enjoyed the ‚Äúfuture predictions‚Äù that were actually movies. The characters were likable, and I enjoy how the arranged marriages actually contain people who like each other.

I highly recommend My Contrary Mary, along with all of the Lady Janies series. I look forward to the next Mary as well!

I brewed a new coffee this morning from JBC via Fellow Drops, and it‚Äôs really good. I brewed a second cup this afternoon and iced it, which was also great.

# Finished: The No-Show



The No-Show by Beth O‚ÄôLeary
The No-Show was different and wonderful. The book is told from the perspectives of three different women; Siobhan, Miranda, and Jane.  At the beginning of the The No-Show, I was most interested in the stories and backgrounds of the three women. Even when I wasn‚Äôt sure what to think about each woman‚Äôs interactions with ‚ÄúNo-Show‚Äù Joseph Carter, I was invested in finding out more about the female characters. 

The way in which everything was connected was so different from what I was expecting. I was enthralled. The characters were well developed with depths that I was excited to uncover. I did not predict what was going on in this book, and it was so much better than what I would have guessed.

After reading Beth O‚ÄôLeary‚Äôs The Flatshare, I had been wanting to read another of her books. I couldn‚Äôt decide between The Switch and The Road Trip. When The No-Show came out recently, I decided to go right for her newest release. 

I also consumed this book entirely through audiobook, because I had a backlog of Audible credits and I saw that one of the narrators is Evanna Lynch, who played Luna Lovegood in the Harry Potter movies. They used a different narrator for each woman and it was really well done.

Spoilers
I was expecting the three women to run into each other and the man to be caught, or for there to be some mystery that they would solve surrounding his missing day. Maybe the man was a spy or had multiple personality disorder or something. That was nothing like what was actually in The No-Show.

I was ready for all of the characters to all come together at the New Years Eve party when it was revealed that they were all in different years! 

The way all of the characters‚Äô stories connected was really amazing. At some point before the end, I realized that something terrible was probably going to happen to Siobhan. It wouldn‚Äôt really make sense otherwise. That was pretty sad. But the way Joseph Carter and Jane‚Äôs stories were intertwined so that they ended up together was pretty cool. They both had so much trauma, they were able to be each other‚Äôs second chances. 

The different years twist really reframed the whole first half of the book! I‚Äôm still going over things in my head and realizing how they fit together. The mysteries were explained in really satisfying ways that enriched the story rather than taking away from it. 

This book is the opposite of Lost.

# Read: They Called Us Enemy



This was a wonderfully presented graphic novel that told George Takei‚Äôs personal story of his experiences at Japanese internment camps during WWII. It was also a memoir of George Takei‚Äôs life after the war. The story from young George‚Äôs perspective was really affective. As a parent with young children, it was especially impactful to read about how the children viewed the experiences with innocence, many times thinking things were fun adventures. And how much the parents worked to keep it that way. 

This is a subject that‚Äôs really underrepresented in  US history. In my high school classes in the late 1990‚Äôs in California, it wasn‚Äôt hidden or ignored completely, but it was kind of a side note. I remember one conversation about it in class. We asked our teacher why they would do this to Japanese Americans, but not German Americans. I‚Äôve been told a family story that my 2x Great Grandfather was German, never learned to read English and received the newspaper in German. He lived in Iowa. During WWII he had to register as a ‚Äúresident alien‚Äù, but that was it. No one labeled him an enemy or relocated his family. 

These recent-history stories are so important, and the personal memoir is so impactful. They Called Us Enemy continued past World War II, and included stories from George Takei‚Äôs life including meeting and marching with Martin Luther King Jr, and being cast on Star Trek. 

I'm interested in the question of when people found out about Japanese internment camps! I was trying to remember for myself when I learned about them. I think middle school is when it was taught in school for me, but I also remember reading about it in a Baby-Sitters Club book. I remember a book where Claudia's grandmother(Mimi) had a stroke, and Claudia learned that she had been in those internment camps. So I may have read that a little earlier than middle school.

My birthday was earlier this month, and as part of my celebration I finally ordered a Book of the Month box. I selected The Wedding Dress Sewing Circle as my book of the month. I added on The Sound of Stars as well, a book which I‚Äôve already read and enjoyed in ebook format.

The Wedding Dress Sewing Circle was a lovely book. It was told from the point of view of three different women in England during World War II. I loved getting to know each character and easing into the village. This book was filled with women helping each other, and included some sweet romance. I also enjoyed the detail about clothes rationing, ‚Äúmake do and mend‚Äù, and wartime ‚Äúutility‚Äù design for clothes.

Book Lovers was an ideal summer read.
My favorite part of Book Lovers was the many excellent book references and book loving quotes. Books are the best, aren‚Äôt they? 
The funny writing in Book Lovers hooked me from the beginning, and I loved the characters and sister relationship. This book gave love to both small towns and big cities, and had a satisfying frenemies-to-lovers type romance.

# Finished: Tomorrow x3
It was nostalgic, with depth. I appreciate the themes of video games and theatre, and the friendship love story.

I actually related to a lot of things in this book.I married a game developer. I loved doing theatre in high school and college. I‚Äôm 9-10 years younger than the main characters, so their childhood and college years were a different timeframe, technologically,  but most were timeframes that I remembered nostalgically. 

I don‚Äôt know what the overlap is between those who have read this book and those who have participated in game development, but most of the reviews I‚Äôm seeing are from people who say they don‚Äôt know too much about games. That‚Äôs fine, but I‚Äôm just curious. Like, how many other people have read this book that have also, for example, opened Unreal Engine? Is it just me?  

--
If this were a movie or TV series, it would be a drama. 

I loved that this story was about a love story that‚Äôs a friendship rather than a romance. 

I related to this book quite a lot. I‚Äôm not asian or jewish, as most of the main characters are.

Other Birds at the Beach



Earlier this week, I celebrated my anniversary(with my husband) at a beautiful beach resort. One of the wonderfully relaxing things I got to do was read on the patio of our ocean view room. Other Birds was a perfect book for spending the last days of summer next to the ocean. I‚Äôm only about halfway through, but it has a wonderful late summer/early fall vibe. 
And yes, I made that coffee with my travel aeropress and hand grinder that I brought with me.

Twitter
Who remembers when you could see everyone's replies?

In the early days we, as a community on Twitter, created the now-ubiquitous hashtag. The hashtag was something that happened organically, and the Twitter team built it into the system. The same thing happened with replies and retweets. 

It was an amazing time when the Twitter team was really paying attention to what the users were doing, and their work reflected it. I don‚Äôt know of any other platform that took so many cues from the community.

# Legendborn Review



I picked up this paperback copy of Legendborn when I found out that it had a bonus short story at the end.

Legendborn has a vivid world and characters. The fantasy elements were exciting, and it kept me guessing how everything would fit together. It turned out to be an even better retelling of the Once and Future King story than I could have imagined, with really satisfying allusions to the story of Arthur. 

I enjoy Arthurian legend, and Legendborn started off seeming like it was going to be a fantasy adventure in the vein of Percy Jackson or The Mortal Instruments, with a character discovering a new magical reality. It was those things, but it got much more personal and complex than I was expecting.

A Cross-Country Christmas



A Cross-Country Christmas was my first holiday book of the season.
This was a sweet holiday romance with the ‚Äúbrother‚Äôs best friend‚Äù trope, and of course a road trip theme. I enjoyed the character‚Äôs redemption arcs, fun banter, and different locations they traveled through. 
 I actually read about 25% of this book last year. I was enjoying it,  but I started it too close to Christmas and was no longer in the mood for it and set it aside. I was kind of still thinking about the characters and how they were doing, so it was an easy choice for my first holiday read.

# Winter Solistice
In the Northern Hemisphere, today is the day with the least sunlight, it‚Äôs called the Winter Solstice, and is often considered the ‚Äúfirst day of winter‚Äù. 

I like marking the seasons astronomically. As a lifelong Californian, I‚Äôve always heard that we don‚Äôt have ‚Äúreal weather‚Äù or ‚Äúreal winter‚Äù. The astronomical seasons are about light. 

It‚Äôs about light, not the weather or temperature. 

I can get behind a story about light that‚Äôs being told all year long, and every year. 

The light shines in the darkness.

And it‚Äôs a good thing that winter is about light, not weather, because today is our warmest day in weeks.

# Hello 2023
I know that every new year takes some getting used to, but this year seems different. It feels like this year, the number 2023 seems more fake than previous new years. Like, the year looks more like the future than it should. 

Just me?

Happy 2023!

Does anyone else think 2023 looks more futuristic than it should?

I know every new year takes getting used to, but seriously. I don't feel like I've gradually progressed to 2023. I'm not ready for this number.

# 2022 Book Wrap Up
Here are all of the books I read in 2022, including re-reads! I love my 2022 Wrap Up on Storygraph. 

I liked all of the books I read in 2022, and I would happily recommend any of them. If I had to pick a couple stand-out books to recommend first, I think they would be...
The No-Show by Beth O‚ÄôLeary
Legendborn and Bloodmarked by Tracy Deonn

Shadowhunter books and Percy Jackson books were all re-reads. I‚Äôm looking forward to new additions to both those series in 2023!

# Finished: The House in the Cerulean Sea
A hopeful book about seeing the good in people.  

Magical people are featured, but it‚Äôs about a person who realizes he is participating in an oppressive structure and seeks to make changes.

Tonight I finished The House in the Cerulean Sea.

# BOTM Pick: Independence
Who else does Book of the Month Club?
The January books are out, and I picked Independence by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni. It‚Äôs a historical fiction about the 1947 Partition of India.

When I watched the Ms Marvel series on Disney\+, I was alarmed to discover that I knew nothing about the partition of India. The depiction in Ms Marvel was devastating.

The Strike at Putney
Last night, I read a short story by Lucy Maud Montgomery(author of Anne of Green Gables) from 1903 called The Strike at Putney. 

It‚Äôs about a group of church ladies who are told by their church elders and minister that a missionary woman cannot speak in the church, because a woman cannot preach from the pulpit.

So they go on strike. They stop organizing socials to raise money, don‚Äôt set fresh flowers out in the church, or clean and dust the church. The organist doesn‚Äôt play, and no women sing in the choir. 

‚ÄúYou know if a woman isn't fit to speak in the church she can't be fit to sing in it either."
The Strike at Putney by L. M. Montgomery

The men last two weeks.

I was delighted to read this story from 120 years ago about women opposing patriarchalism in church.

# RAID
The external hard drive that I used for the ‚Äúlocal‚Äù copies of photos and other files failed earlier this week, and I replaced it with a new OWC #RAID array. 

Now I‚Äôm just waiting for files to download to it from my #Synology #NAS.

# Classic Homepage Progress
I‚Äôve been building a new personal website. I call it my ‚Äúclassic homepage‚Äù.  I actually started it over a year ago, and had just made a couple of pages with some pictures and old gifs. 

Since joining the fediverse, I‚Äôve seen what seems like a resurgence of personal websites. It‚Äôs exciting! 

So I got excited to work on my Homepage. I made a Now page, and a Follow page instead of a link tree. 

I‚Äôm just using plain html and css for now, but it feels good to make something that‚Äôs mine again.

I‚Äôm also running the website off of my Synology NAS, which is fun.
