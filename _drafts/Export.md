# Read: They Called Us Enemy



This was a wonderfully presented graphic novel that told George Takei‚Äôs personal story of his experiences at Japanese internment camps during WWII. It was also a memoir of George Takei‚Äôs life after the war. The story from young George‚Äôs perspective was really affective. As a parent with young children, it was especially impactful to read about how the children viewed the experiences with innocence, many times thinking things were fun adventures. And how much the parents worked to keep it that way. 

This is a subject that‚Äôs really underrepresented in  US history. In my high school classes in the late 1990‚Äôs in California, it wasn‚Äôt hidden or ignored completely, but it was kind of a side note. I remember one conversation about it in class. We asked our teacher why they would do this to Japanese Americans, but not German Americans. I‚Äôve been told a family story that my 2x Great Grandfather was German, never learned to read English and received the newspaper in German. He lived in Iowa. During WWII he had to register as a ‚Äúresident alien‚Äù, but that was it. No one labeled him an enemy or relocated his family. 

These recent-history stories are so important, and the personal memoir is so impactful. They Called Us Enemy continued past World War II, and included stories from George Takei‚Äôs life including meeting and marching with Martin Luther King Jr, and being cast on Star Trek. 

I'm interested in the question of when people found out about Japanese internment camps! I was trying to remember for myself when I learned about them. I think middle school is when it was taught in school for me, but I also remember reading about it in a Baby-Sitters Club book. I remember a book where Claudia's grandmother(Mimi) had a stroke, and Claudia learned that she had been in those internment camps. So I may have read that a little earlier than middle school.

I was planning to space out my re-read of Chain of Gold and Chain of Iron when I was expecting a November release of the final book in The Last Hours trilogy. Since the release date for Chain of Thorns has been moved to January 2023, I decided to just read the first two books now and enjoy them!

BotM June 2022



My birthday was earlier this month, and as part of my celebration I finally ordered a Book of the Month box. I selected The Wedding Dress Sewing Circle as my book of the month. I added on The Sound of Stars as well, a book which I‚Äôve already read and enjoyed in ebook format. 

The box was really cute, and I love these beautiful hardcover editions.

# Finished



The Wedding Dress Sewing Circle was a lovely book. It was told from the point of view of three different women in England during World War II. I loved getting to know each character and easing into the village. This book was filled with women helping each other, and included some sweet romance. I also enjoyed the detail about clothes rationing, ‚Äúmake do and mend‚Äù, and wartime ‚Äúutility‚Äù design for clothes.

Book Lovers was an ideal summer read.
My favorite part of Book Lovers was the many excellent book references and book loving quotes. Books are the best, aren‚Äôt they? 
The funny writing in Book Lovers hooked me from the beginning, and I loved the characters and sister relationship. This book gave love to both small towns and big cities, and had a satisfying frenemies-to-lovers type romance.

# Finished: Tomorrow x3
It was nostalgic, with depth. I appreciate the themes of video games and theatre, and the friendship love story.

I actually related to a lot of things in this book.I married a game developer. I loved doing theatre in high school and college. I‚Äôm 9-10 years younger than the main characters, so their childhood and college years were a different timeframe, technologically,  but most were timeframes that I remembered nostalgically. 

I don‚Äôt know what the overlap is between those who have read this book and those who have participated in game development, but most of the reviews I‚Äôm seeing are from people who say they don‚Äôt know too much about games. That‚Äôs fine, but I‚Äôm just curious. Like, how many other people have read this book that have also, for example, opened Unreal Engine? Is it just me?  

--
If this were a movie or TV series, it would be a drama. 

I loved that this story was about a love story that‚Äôs a friendship rather than a romance. 

I related to this book quite a lot. I‚Äôm not asian or jewish, as most of the main characters are.

Other Birds at the Beach



Earlier this week, I celebrated my anniversary(with my husband) at a beautiful beach resort. One of the wonderfully relaxing things I got to do was read on the patio of our ocean view room. Other Birds was a perfect book for spending the last days of summer next to the ocean. I‚Äôm only about halfway through, but it has a wonderful late summer/early fall vibe. 
And yes, I made that coffee with my travel aeropress and hand grinder that I brought with me.

October is here, and I‚Äôve got my fall pumpkin mug and The Kiss Curse(sequel to last year‚Äôs perfectly halloweenish The Ex Hex). After a few chapters of The Kiss Curse, I was ready to get out my Halloween stuff. 

My middle child has a September 28 birthday, so I was focused on that. Then suddenly it was October! Now I‚Äôm fully in the mood for Halloween.

Twitter
Who remembers when you could see everyone's replies?

In the early days we, as a community on Twitter, created the now-ubiquitous hashtag. The hashtag was something that happened organically, and the Twitter team built it into the system. The same thing happened with replies and retweets. 

It was an amazing time when the Twitter team was really paying attention to what the users were doing, and their work reflected it. I don‚Äôt know of any other platform that took so many cues from the community.

# Legendborn Review



I picked up this paperback copy of Legendborn when I found out that it had a bonus short story at the end.

Legendborn has a vivid world and characters. The fantasy elements were exciting, and it kept me guessing how everything would fit together. It turned out to be an even better retelling of the Once and Future King story than I could have imagined, with really satisfying allusions to the story of Arthur. 

I enjoy Arthurian legend, and Legendborn started off seeming like it was going to be a fantasy adventure in the vein of Percy Jackson or The Mortal Instruments, with a character discovering a new magical reality. It was those things, but it got much more personal and complex than I was expecting.

A Cross-Country Christmas



A Cross-Country Christmas was my first holiday book of the season.
This was a sweet holiday romance with the ‚Äúbrother‚Äôs best friend‚Äù trope, and of course a road trip theme. I enjoyed the character‚Äôs redemption arcs, fun banter, and different locations they traveled through. 
 I actually read about 25% of this book last year. I was enjoying it,  but I started it too close to Christmas and was no longer in the mood for it and set it aside. I was kind of still thinking about the characters and how they were doing, so it was an easy choice for my first holiday read.
