Other Birds at the Beach



Earlier this week, I celebrated my anniversary(with my husband) at a beautiful beach resort. One of the wonderfully relaxing things I got to do was read on the patio of our ocean view room. Other Birds was a perfect book for spending the last days of summer next to the ocean. I‚Äôm only about halfway through, but it has a wonderful late summer/early fall vibe. 
And yes, I made that coffee with my travel aeropress and hand grinder that I brought with me.

# October Reading Begins



October is here, and I‚Äôve got my fall pumpkin mug and The Kiss Curse(sequel to last year‚Äôs perfectly halloweenish The Ex Hex). After a few chapters of The Kiss Curse, I was ready to get out my Halloween stuff. 

My middle child has a September 28 birthday, so I was focused on that. Then suddenly it was October! Now I‚Äôm fully in the mood for Halloween.

# The Kiss Curse



Halloween vibes! Sequel to last year‚Äôs book, The Ex Hex. The Kiss Curse is a fun Halloween themed witchy contemporary romance. Fast and funny with a tiny bit of mystery/suspense and a few steamy scenes.

I‚Äôve moved onto another witch themed book for October, and so far, it‚Äôs so wonderful and cozy. Cozy fantasy is a thing, right? I‚Äôm here for it.

# November 



Is it just me, or does the day after a holiday feel like a book hangover?
I also finished a book on Halloween, so November 1 felt extra fuzzy.

Twitter
Who remembers when you could see everyone's replies?

In the early days we, as a community on Twitter, created the now-ubiquitous hashtag. The hashtag was something that happened organically, and the Twitter team built it into the system. The same thing happened with replies and retweets. 

It was an amazing time when the Twitter team was really paying attention to what the users were doing, and their work reflected it. I don‚Äôt know of any other platform that took so many cues from the community.

# Legendborn Review



I picked up this paperback copy of Legendborn when I found out that it had a bonus short story at the end.

Legendborn has a vivid world and characters. The fantasy elements were exciting, and it kept me guessing how everything would fit together. It turned out to be an even better retelling of the Once and Future King story than I could have imagined, with really satisfying allusions to the story of Arthur. 

I enjoy Arthurian legend, and Legendborn started off seeming like it was going to be a fantasy adventure in the vein of Percy Jackson or The Mortal Instruments, with a character discovering a new magical reality. It was those things, but it got much more personal and complex than I was expecting.

# Bloodmarked Review



It was so good. I couldn‚Äôt put it down.
Fantasy, action, lovable characters. I thought they might be about to take down every hierarchical structure standing in their way at some points. 

I would preorder a book three right now if it were possible.

LitJoy Crate



I finally received my Summer LitJoyCrate. This was my first box from them. It was delayed due to delays in the printing of the books. I think it was worth the wait! I‚Äôve already enjoyed this book via Audiobook. I love all of the Jane and Mary books! One of my favorite items in this box is the Lantern Waste bookplates.

# Kettle



I‚Äôve been enjoying this beautiful kettle by Fellow Products, who make the dreamiest things for coffee lovers. It was supposed to be a Christmas present, but my old kettle stopped working so my husband gave it to me early. This pink kettle brings me joy every time I see it in the kitchen!

A Cross-Country Christmas



A Cross-Country Christmas was my first holiday book of the season.
This was a sweet holiday romance with the ‚Äúbrother‚Äôs best friend‚Äù trope, and of course a road trip theme. I enjoyed the character‚Äôs redemption arcs, fun banter, and different locations they traveled through. 
 I actually read about 25% of this book last year. I was enjoying it,  but I started it too close to Christmas and was no longer in the mood for it and set it aside. I was kind of still thinking about the characters and how they were doing, so it was an easy choice for my first holiday read.

# Currently 
I‚Äôm trying to read my Christmasy books before it‚Äôs too late, so I‚Äôm #CurrentlyReading

Once Upon a December by Amy E. Reichert - A holiday romance about a magical Christmas market. I‚Äôm 80% through.
Father Christmas and Me by Matt Haig - I read the first two books in this delightful middle grade series last year, and have just begun this third book in the series. 

I‚Äôm reading both of these with the Kindle and Audible versions. It‚Äôs really nice to listen to the audiobooks while I wrap Christmas presents!

I‚Äôm also still working on my Percy Jackson book reread, with the final book in the Heroes of Olympus series.
The Blood of Olympus by Rick Riordan

Once Upon a December
This book grabbed me with the quote at the front from The Screwtape Letters, one of my all time favorite books. 

Once Upon a December is mostly a romance with a magical Christmas market, as well as some personal drama  with the main character, and great female friendships.

# Hello 2023
I know that every new year takes some getting used to, but this year seems different. It feels like this year, the number 2023 seems more fake than previous new years. Like, the year looks more like the future than it should. 

Just me?

Happy 2023!

Does anyone else think 2023 looks more futuristic than it should?

I know every new year takes getting used to, but seriously. I don't feel like I've gradually progressed to 2023. I'm not ready for this number.

The No-Show by Beth O‚ÄôLeary
Legendborn and Bloodmarked by Tracy Deonn

Shadowhunter books and Percy Jackson books were all re-reads. I‚Äôm looking forward to new additions to both those series in 2023!

# Finished: The House in the Cerulean Sea
A hopeful book about seeing the good in people.  

Magical people are featured, but it‚Äôs about a person who realizes he is participating in an oppressive structure and seeks to make changes.

Tonight I finished The House in the Cerulean Sea.

# BOTM Pick: Independence
Who else does Book of the Month Club?
The January books are out, and I picked Independence by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni. It‚Äôs a historical fiction about the 1947 Partition of India.

When I watched the Ms Marvel series on Disney\+, I was alarmed to discover that I knew nothing about the partition of India. The depiction in Ms Marvel was devastating.

# Classic Homepage Progress
I‚Äôve been building a new personal website. I call it my ‚Äúclassic homepage‚Äù.  I actually started it over a year ago, and had just made a couple of pages with some pictures and old gifs. 

Since joining the fediverse, I‚Äôve seen what seems like a resurgence of personal websites. It‚Äôs exciting! 

So I got excited to work on my Homepage. I made a Now page, and a Follow page instead of a link tree. 

I‚Äôm just using plain html and css for now, but it feels good to make something that‚Äôs mine again.

I‚Äôm also running the website off of my Synology NAS, which is fun.
