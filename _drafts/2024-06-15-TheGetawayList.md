Reading this book was like hanging out with friends and exploring New York with them for the summer.
**Seasonal Vibe:** Summer
Starts with a high school graduation and takes place during the summer after graduation.
**Travel Location:** New York City

There is a romance, but mostly this is a story about a group of friends figuring out what they love and what they want to do next. Thereâ€™s also a really nice theme about books and writing, with the main two characters having bonded over a beloved(fictional) childrenâ€™s fantasy series as kids. This is realistic YA fiction that touches on how people can use fantasy stories to navigate the real world and their relationships. There was also a theme about coding and app development that I was surprised to discover.

I started reading The Getaway List on the perfect day for me. I had just been to my youngest daughterâ€™s preschool graduation and it was the last day of school for my older two kids, with my oldest daughter singing in the choir at the promotion for her middle schoolâ€™s 8th graders. It had a perfect vibe for the end of the school year and looking forward to summer, and was a nice easy read for my tired mom brain.
