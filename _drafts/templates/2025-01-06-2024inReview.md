I'm welcoming 2025 AD/CE with cautious optimism. 
Good
- Read lots of books
- Went to several book events, including yallwest, and a few smaller book signings.

The main event that defined my year and changed my life happened in February. My son Caspian, then 7 years old, was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes and spent several nights in the hospital.
