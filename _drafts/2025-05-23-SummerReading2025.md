If you're looking for something to read this summer, this list is a mix of old and new books that I can happily recommend. Not only do they all exist*, but I have read them. They're not all explicitly summer-themed, but I think they would be good for reading in the summer.

This list includes Adult, YA, and Children's(middle grade) books, but I wrote these recommendations with adult readers in mind. If you have a child or teen in your life that would also enjoy the YA or kid lit suggestions, that's a bonus. Maybe you can read them together!

[The Ornithologist's Field Guide to Love](https://www.indiaholton.com/books/the-ornithologists-field-guide-to-love) is a truly delightful book, with a perfect blend of magic, humor, romance, and a “historical” setting. It takes place in the summer, despite being a Light Academia book.

> When a competition to become Birder of the Year is announced, rival professors Beth Pickering and Devon Lockley are forced to team up to have any chance of winning. They simply can't trust anyone, including each other - for while all may be fair in love and war, this is ornithology!
