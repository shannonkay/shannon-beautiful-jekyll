Make and do things for your own enjoyment. Do it for the joy it brings you. 

What is a Hobby Not
- A Hobby does not have to be productive
- You don't have to be "good" at your hobby
- You don't have to "finish" your hobby project
- You don't have to go "all in" on a hobby or seek complete collections of things to enjoy that hobby.
- A hobby doesn't need to become a business

A Hobby Is
- Enjoyable
- Something you want to do
- Anything you do for fun can be a hobby
- Things you like
- When you're an enthusiast

Some hobbies have sub-categories
