We normally go to the Christmas tree farm on opening day, but it was really windy, with a red flag warning. We visited the Christmas tree farm the next day, Sunday, instead. The old Peltzer Pines location in Brea closed after last year. We visited their farm in Silverado Canyon instead.

I got the mostly-matching floral boots for all the girls from the Target kids section.

You wouldn't think that one day would make such a big difference, but most of the really good trees were already sold.

We picked a tree that was just ok. But the kids won't care, and at least we still got to support our local farm.
