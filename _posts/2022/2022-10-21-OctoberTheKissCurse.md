October is here, and I’ve got my fall pumpkin mug and [The Kiss Curse by Erin Sterling](https://www.rachelhawkinsbooks.com/erin-sterling-books/paranormal-romances/the-kiss-curse/)(sequel to last year’s perfectly halloweenish [The Ex Hex](https://blog.shannonkay.me/2021/10-18-theexhex/)). After a few chapters of The Kiss Curse, I was ready to get out my Halloween stuff.

This book has Halloween vibes! Sequel to last year’s book, The Ex Hex. The Kiss Curse is a fun Halloween themed witchy contemporary romance. Fast and funny with a tiny bit of mystery/suspense and a few steamy scenes.

Summary:

>Gwyn Jones is perfectly happy with her life in Graves Glen. She, her mom, and her cousin have formed a new and powerful coven; she’s running a successful witchcraft shop, Something Wicked; and she’s started mentoring some of the younger witches in town. As Halloween approaches, there’s only one problem—Llewellyn “Wells” Penhallow.
>
 Wells has come to Graves Glen to re-establish his family’s connection to the town they founded as well as to make a new life for himself after years of being the dutiful son in Wales. When he opens up a shop of his own, Penhallow’s, just across the street from Something Wicked, he quickly learns he’s gotten more than he bargained for in going up against Gwyn.
 >
 When their professional competition leads to a very personal—and very hot—kiss, both Wells and Gwyn are determined to stay away from each other, convinced the kiss was just a magical fluke. But when a mysterious new coven of witches come to town and Gwyn’s powers begin fading, she and Wells must work together to figure out just what these new witches want and how to restore Gwyn’s magic before it’s too late.
