My birthday was earlier this month, and as part of my celebration I finally ordered a Book of the Month box. I selected The Wedding Dress Sewing Circle as my book of the month. I added on The Sound of Stars as well, a book which Iâ€™ve already read and enjoyed in ebook format. 

The box was really cute, and I love these beautiful hardcover editions.
