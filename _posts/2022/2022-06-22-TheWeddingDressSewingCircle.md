The Wedding Dress Sewing Circle was a lovely book. It was told from the point of view of three different women in England during World War II. I loved getting to know each character and easing into the village. This book was filled with women helping each other, and included some sweet romance. I also enjoyed the detail about clothes rationing, “make do and mend”, and wartime “utility” design for clothes. 

It’s been a while since I’ve read a historical fiction that wasn’t also a fantasy.
