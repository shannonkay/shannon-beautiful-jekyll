In the Northern Hemisphere, today is the day with the least sunlight, it’s called the Winter Solstice, and is often considered the “first day of winter”. 

I like marking the seasons astronomically. As a lifelong Californian, I’ve always heard that we don’t have “real weather” or “real winter”. The astronomical seasons are about light. 

It’s about light, not the weather or temperature. 

I can get behind a story about light that’s being told all year long, and every year. 

*The light shines in the darkness.*

And it’s a good thing that winter is about light, not weather, because today is our warmest day in weeks. 

Total Daylight: 9hr 54min
