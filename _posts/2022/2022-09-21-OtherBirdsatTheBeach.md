Earlier this week, I celebrated my anniversary(with my husband) at a beautiful beach resort. One of the wonderfully relaxing things I got to do was read on the patio of our ocean view room. Other Birds by Sarah Addison Allen was a perfect book for spending the last days of summer next to the ocean. Iâ€™m only about halfway through, but it has a wonderful late summer/early fall vibe. 
And yes, I made that coffee with my [travel aeropress](https://aeropress.com/products/aeropress-go-travel-coffee-press) and hand grinder that I brought with me.
