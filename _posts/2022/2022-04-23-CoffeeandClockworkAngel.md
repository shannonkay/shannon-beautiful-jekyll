Coffee pictured with my gorgeous 10th Anniversary  edition of Clockwork Angel. Unfortunately, Iâ€™ve completed my chronological-ish reread of shadow hunter books and Iâ€™m trying not to start re-reading The Last Hours yet, since the final book in that series is not coming out until ~~November~~ January.

I brewed a new coffee this morning from [JBC](https://jbccoffeeroasters.com) via [Fellow Drops](https://drops.fellowproducts.com), and itâ€™s really good. I brewed a second cup this afternoon and iced it, which was also great.
