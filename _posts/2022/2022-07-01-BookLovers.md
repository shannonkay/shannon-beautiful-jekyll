Book and coffee pairing!  Book Lovers was an ideal summer read.

My favorite part of Book Lovers was the many excellent book references and book loving quotes. Books are the best, arenâ€™t they? 

The funny writing in Book Lovers hooked me from the beginning, and I loved the characters and sister relationship. This book gave love to both small towns and big cities, and had a satisfying frenemies-to-lovers type romance.
