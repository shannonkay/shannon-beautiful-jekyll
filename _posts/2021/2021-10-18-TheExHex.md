This was a fun, fast book that felt like an adult Sabrina the Teenage Witch plus Halloweentown(yes, the Disney Channel movie). I enjoyed this modern witch romantic comedy with a tiny bit of light mystery. I liked that it had chapters in the perspective of both main characters, so I really felt that I got to know them.

## Finished: The Ex Hex (Ex Hex, #1) by Erin Sterling 
The Ex Hex was a light, non-scary book that had a nice vibe for Halloweentime.

I switched back and forth between the Kindle ebook and Audible audiobook editions, and both were good.

I thought the intimate scenes were slightly more adult than in something like a Sophie Kinsella book. 

Summary: 
>Nine years ago, Vivienne Jones nursed her broken heart like any young witch would: vodka, weepy music, bubble baths…and a curse on the horrible boyfriend. Sure, Vivi knows she shouldn’t use her magic this way, but with only an “orchard hayride” scented candle on hand, she isn’t worried it will cause him anything more than a bad hair day or two.

>That is until Rhys Penhallow, descendent of the town’s ancestors, breaker of hearts, and annoyingly just as gorgeous as he always was, returns to Graves Glen, Georgia. What should be a quick trip to recharge the town’s ley lines and make an appearance at the annual fall festival turns disastrously wrong. With one calamity after another striking Rhys, Vivi realizes her silly little Ex Hex may not have been so harmless after all.

>Suddenly, Graves Glen is under attack from murderous wind-up toys, a pissed off ghost, and a talking cat with some interesting things to say. Vivi and Rhys have to ignore their off the charts chemistry to work together to save the town and find a way to break the break-up curse before it’s too late.
