I finished reading My Contrary Mary today, and it did not disappoint. More of a review of the book will be coming soon. Life and kids got in the way of my finishing it sooner, but I was excited to finish reading My Contrary Mary on my new Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition.

The Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition is a nice upgrade from my older Kindle Paperwhite. Some points of improvement: 
- Modern charging standards, with a USB-C port and wireless charging
- No ads!
- The option to show my current book cover on the ad-free screen when itâ€™s locked
- A flush screen, not a screen thatâ€™s lower than the bezel (as on my previous Kindle)
- Faster loading, and better responsiveness
- Nice case that automatically locks and unlocks when I open and close it. (Wireless charging works through the case too!)
- Audible support with bluetooth for headphones (though I havenâ€™t tried this yet).

Overall, this Kindle is definitely worth upgrading to!
