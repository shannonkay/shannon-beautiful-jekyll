[Tom Lake](https://www.annpatchett.com/tom-lake) is a gorgeous summertime literary fiction. I loved the themes of theatre and family. During the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns in 2020, a mother tells her three daughters about her past as an actress while they pick cherries in their family orchard. Most of the stories are about a summer production of Our Town in the 1980â€™s, at a theatre company called Tom Lake. And there is a lake!

Iâ€™m the oldest of three girls, and I loved the relationship of the three daughters to each other and their parents. I studied theatre, and I loved the descriptions of the theatre. Auditions, rehearsals, the show must go on! I also related strongly to Laraâ€™s relationship with her grandmother. Iâ€™ve definitely volunteered for things because my grandma told me to, and I grew up sewing with my grandma, and also my childhood best friendâ€™s grandmother would sew with us.Â 

The audiobook is narrated exquisitely by Meryl Streep. I also felt like the writing was so good, I would like to read it for myself. I kept listening to the audio because it was so good, but I loved the book so much, I ordered a special edition hardcover from Waterstones.
