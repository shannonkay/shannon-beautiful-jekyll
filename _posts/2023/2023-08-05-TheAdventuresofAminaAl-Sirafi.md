The Adventures of Amina Al-Sirafi by [Shannon Chakraborty](https://www.sachakraborty.com) is a great historical fantasy adventure. Amina Al-Sirafi is a middle-aged piratey sea captain who is persuaded out of retirement and away from her daughter. What she thinks will be a fact finding and rescue mission to recover the daughter of a former crewman turns into a full scale supernatural adventure. 

This book had a lovely, satisfying ending. Open ended with room for more stories, but not in a cliffhanger way. 

I got my book from [Book of the Month Club](https://www.mybotm.com/2m2gm3t3xg7?show_box=true) and read it in hardcover, as well as listening to the audiobook for some of it.
