It's time to select my [Book of the Month Club](https://www.mybotm.com/2m2gm3t3xg7?show_box=true) pick for May. I'm excited because this will be my 12th box, and I want the tote bag! I’m also excited about having a full year of books stamped with their months. Next month is also my birthday month. I'm really interested in [The Secret Book of Flora Lea by Patti Callahan Henry](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/bad19101-1306-47b0-a500-b16f37f6d492). I wish that was a main pick! 

I was looking at The Collected Regrets of Clover or Paper Names, but I didn't quite "vibe" with the book samples. I wasn't originally considering [Did You Hear About Kitty Karr by Crystal Smith Paul](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/442623d5-2c57-4215-a6d9-e05459ee0ca4), and I can't remember why. I went back and read the sample, and I liked it, so I’m going with Kitty Karr and Flora Lea as an add-on.

Here’s my box! I’m so excited for the tote bag!
