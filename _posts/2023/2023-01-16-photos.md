I received a new Fujifilm X-T5 camera for Christmas, but I haven’t gotten to play with it much because our family was sick for most of winter break. Then it was very rainy and cloudy most days. The sun is finally out again, and I took the opportunity to pull out the camera.

Beatrix was my only cooperative model.

I’m still figuring out where all the controls are. I’ve had a Fuji XT-200 and Canon DSLRs.
