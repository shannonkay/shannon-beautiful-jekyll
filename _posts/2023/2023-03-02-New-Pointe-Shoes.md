Guinevereâ€™s first pair of Pointe shoes got too small and it hurt when she tried to dance in them. It was hard to get an appointment for a fitting at The Pointe Shop, so we ended up with a fitting just a couple hours before her ballet class.Â 
  
The pointe shoe fitter could tell her old shoes were too small before she even took them all the way out. Guinevere was quickly fitted for new shoes and we drove straight to the dance studio. We got there one hour before her regular ballet class, with two hours until she was supposed to do pointe.Â 

I still had to sew on the ribbons and elastics. When she got her first pointe shoes, it took a long time to get the ribbons and elastics sewn on in the right places. Did you know that you have to sew those on yourself? You do. With her first shoes, it took multiple tries, many hours, and lots of consulting with her ballet teacher.Â

With two hours until she was supposed to dance in them, I managed to get everything sewn on in the right places on the first try. Iâ€™m really proud of myself. Dance mom level achieved! Now she needs to learn to sew them on herself.
