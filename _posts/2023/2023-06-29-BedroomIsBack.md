After having the carpet installed on Friday, we were just waiting for the stuff from our bedroom that they packed out to be returned.Â This morning they brought the pod back and moved everything back in and assembled the furniture.Â 

There are still a lot of boxes of things to unpack, but Iâ€™ll be so happy to sleep in my own bed in my own room again tonight.

The new paint color looks really pretty, and the white ceiling is so much better than the stormy grey that it used to be. The room looks noticeably brighter!Â I'm so happy to have an end to this saga that started in February.

Hereâ€™s a picture of the newly painted walls and new carpet before the furniture went back in. For the "before" photos with the room lacking in walls and carpet, [see my previous post](https://blog.shannonkay.me/2023/04-27-paintandcarpet/).
