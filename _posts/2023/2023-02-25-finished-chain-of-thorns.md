I’ve finished Chain of Thorns, and The Last Hours series of Shadowhunter books has concluded for me.

The anticipation for Chain of Thorns was at the forefront of my reading brain, and I had trouble thinking about what to read next after the “holiday book” reading season. Knowing Chain of Thorns was coming out at the end of January left me indecisive about other reading. 

I enjoyed reading a book that I was so looking forward to. I didn’t rush it. But now I have a book series hangover. 

After anticipating a book for two years, it’s strange for it to have ended. What do I do now? 

Luckily, there are other new releases that I’m excited about this year, and of course the many books that are already available on my hopefuls list.

It’s nice that I have my “re-read” to fall back on when I need something to read for bedtime. I’m now on the second book in the Trials of Apollo series as part of my Percy Jackson book re-read. I’m excited about The Sun and The Star coming out in May. It takes place after the Trials of Apollo series, so I’m hoping to complete my Trials of Apollo revisit just in time to read that new book.
