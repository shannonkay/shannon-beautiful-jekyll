Currently bouncing back and forth between two different books, one hardcover and one digital book. I like them both, but I keep getting interrupted when I sit down and open The Secret Book of Flora Lea. For that reason, I’m further along in The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet. 

My birthday is this week! I’m hoping to celebrate with a little extra reading time.

Coffee: Colombia El Diviso Red Bourbon By [Immigrant Culture](https://fellowproducts.com/blogs/brew-talks/fellows-take-on-colombia-el-diviso-red-bourbon-by-immigrant-culture-pour-over-brew-guide) via [Fellow Drops](https://drops.fellowproducts.com). Brewed with [Aeropress](https://aeropress.com).
