I went over to my parents’ house. Since we’re planning on having a tea party next weekend, my mom and I got out the china. I believe this china has been in my parents’ possession since my paternal grandmother passed away when I was 5(which was in 1988), but I think it’s been packed away for most of that time and I don’t remember having seen it at all. My mom may have used it for something when I was a child, but I don’t remember it.

This china was purchased in England by my paternal grandfather(who was in the Air Force during WWII). We got out the teacups first. I checked the bottom of the cup, and found the stamp. Royal Worcester, Made in England, Mayfair. I thought Royal Worcester was likely the manufacturer, and Mayfair was probably the name of the pattern.

I quickly did a web search and found the [Royal Worcester Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Worcester) page. Wow! It started in 1751 and is either the oldest or second-oldest English porcelain brand.  I found a page on Replacements.com for the [Mayfair pattern](https://www.replacements.com/china-royal-worcester-mayfair/c/88030) and started comparing the pieces that we had.

I also found the website for the [Royal Worcester Museum,](https://www.museumofroyalworcester.org) and learned that they once had a showroom on Curzon Street! I was like “That’s where James and Cordelia live!” (The Last Hours by Cassandra Clare).
