I finished _The Secret Book of Flora Lea_ by Patti Callahan Henry last night, and loved it. 

This book had...
- Delightful literary references.
- Scenes that moved back and forth between 1960 and 1939/1940
- Characters that I loved
- Descriptions of places that made me want to visit them.
- A resolution that I couldn’t guess
