We attended our second concert in as many days on Friday night. It had been a while since I attended a live performance that didn‚Äôt star one of my children.

Friday night at the Hollywood Bowl was amazing. I thought I might burst into tears a couple of times. We were excited to hear The Beths play again, this time opening at the Hollywood Bowl before Death Cab for Cutie and The Postal Service for the 20th anniversary of tour of Transatlanticism and Give Up. We had tickets to this concert already and were delighted to discover that our recent favorite, The Beths, were the opening act that night. I got a pin from The Beths concert the night before, and added it to my Death Cab/Postal Service tote bag.¬†

The tote bag has an added pin that looks like a white t-shirt which says The Beths on it. The Hollywood Bowl can be seen in the background.](/assets/img/2023/20231013.22.43-38.jpg)

It was so nice to hear both bands complimenting each other.¬†I hope Liz Stokes was able to hear Ben Gibbard call her one of the greatest songwriters of her generation. I wish we could‚Äôve gone to see The Beths play again this weekend!
