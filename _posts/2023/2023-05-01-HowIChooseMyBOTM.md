- Scan the genres
- Look at the covers and titles
- Read the descriptions and recommendations blurbs
- Look up books of interest on Goodreads and Storygraph
- Check the number of pages (I don't want my hard cover to be too heavy)
- Check the Book of the Month Club Reddit group to see what other people are picking
- Read the sample excerpt in the Book of the Month app
- Don’t “vibe” with any of the sample excerpts so far? Start over.
