My husband got us tickets to The Postal Service & Death Cab For Cutie playing Give Up & Transatlanticism at the Hollywood Bowl in October.

I was excited! These are two of my all-time favorite albums. 

I was alarmed to realize that they’re probably doing this concert because it’s the 20th anniversary of both albums. That stung a bit.

I’m still excited. I think I’ll preorder the t-shirt and the tote bag.
