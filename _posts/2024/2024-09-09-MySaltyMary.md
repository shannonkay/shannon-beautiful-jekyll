My Salty Mary might be the perfect beach read. It has pirates and mermaids, humor, romance, some “improved” history, and disruption of hierarchical systems. What’s not to love?

I saved My Salty Mary to read during a beach weekend with my husband to celebrate our anniversary, and I think it was the ideal book to enjoy. 

This might be the most Titanic(movie) references in a Lady Janies book yet, and I’m here for it. This series is amazing, and I love it.
