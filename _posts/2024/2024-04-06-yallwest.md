This year, I went to [yallwest](https://www.yallwest.com) for the first time. That's a Young Adult book festival in Santa Monica. I went by myself and had a great time meeting people and attending panels. 

<a href="https://photo.shannonkay.com/Events/Yallwest-2024/i-76Mx8B7/A"><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/Events/Yallwest-2024/i-76Mx8B7/0/Ctsp8xwsPKRxd2SshH3Gpq3b2VMD6JH9nXqs4KkJ6/M/20240504.10.44-002-M.jpg" alt=""></a>

I brought two books to get signed, and both authors had lines that required wristbands. I was excited to get wristbands for both lines.

The first was [Tracy Deonn](https://www.tracydeonn.com). I brought my copy of Bloodmarked for her to sign. I was excited to receive art prints while I waited in line!

And here I am telling Tracy Deonn about my list of books with the word [cariad](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cariad) in them while she signs my book.

#### Books with "cariad"
- [Legendborn](https://www.tracydeonn.com/legendborn) by Tracy Deonn
 - [The Infernal Devices](https://cassandraclare.com/series/the-infernal-devices/) by Cassandra Clare
 - [Howl's Moving Castle](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL9952961M/Howl's_Moving_Castle) by [Diana Wynne Jones](http://www.dianawynnejones.com)

My second signing line was [Tahereh Mafi](https://taherehmafi.com), whose current series, [This Woven Kingdom](https://www.harpercollins.com/products/this-woven-kingdom-tahereh-mafi?variant=40332913279010), I read for the first time in March. I brought my copy of [These Infinite Threads](https://www.harpercollins.com/products/these-infinite-threads-tahereh-mafi?variant=40566299656226) for her to sign.

I then rushed to catch the end of an audiobook narrator workshop, which was a fun time for me. 

I also got to meet [Kamilah Cole](https://www.kamilah-cole.com), whose debut novel, [So Let Them Burn](https://www.kamilah-cole.com/soletthemburn), I was currently reading and near the end of. I was actually listening to the audiobook in the car on the way to the festival!

<a href="https://photo.shannonkay.com/Events/Yallwest-2024/i-wHpBJg5/A"><img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/Events/Yallwest-2024/i-wHpBJg5/0/DS6JfhkxMbfg5nT65BqrXfkcPzK945rR87cNnS2J7/M/20240504.13.57-022-M.jpg" alt=""></a>

Kamilah was a delight to talk to. I told her that I was 80-90% through her book and really enjoying it, and she said "Oh, I'm so sorry!" and I think that was the first time I've had an author personally apologize for their book's ending before I've read it. 

I didn't have a physical book, but she signed one of the blank bookmarks that I brought, and we took a selfie. 

Here are the panels I attended.
