[This Night is Ours](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/ronni-davis/this-night-is-ours/9780316373616/) by [Ronni Davis](https://www.ronnidavisauthor.com) was a wonderful book about understanding yourself with friendship, some romance, and art. The characters and relationships feel very authentic. The book takes place all in 24 hours, on the Summer Solstice. Itâ€™s a wonderful book I happily recommend for teens and up.
