We got a new NAS! Itâ€™s a [Synology DiskStation DS1522+](https://www.synology.com/en-us/products/DS1522+) to replace the DiskStation DS1511+ weâ€™ve been running for over 13 years(solidly and beautifully).

Iâ€™m swooning over the stack of 22 TB hard drives weâ€™ve installed and can hardly contain my excitement at seeing 100 TB of hard drives in my server.Â 

It took a while to transfer everything from the old NAS(DiskStation DS1511+) and do a restore, but now we have things running on it easily that I was struggling with before.Â 

Iâ€™m excited!
