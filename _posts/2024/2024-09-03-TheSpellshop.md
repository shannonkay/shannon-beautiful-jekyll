[The Spellshop](http://sarahbethdurst.com/Spellshop.htm) is a delightful cottagecore cozy fantasy. A librarian is hiding spellbooks with her talking plant companion. She makes and sells jam(and spells) on a small island with winged cats. Friendly townsfolk include a baker and a handsome man who takes care of merhorses. There is a romance, but I thought the friendship and found family aspects were more prominent.
