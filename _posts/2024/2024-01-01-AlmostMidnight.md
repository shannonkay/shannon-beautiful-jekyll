Happy New Year! I truly love Rainbow Rowell’s New Year’s Eve themed short story, Midnights, and I already have it in two other volumes of her short stories. This year, I was delighted to enjoy the story in this adorably small paperback, which also has unique illustrations that are not in the other volumes.

I also enjoyed Kindred Spirits, a story about camping out to see Star Wars Episode VII in 2015. I’m now somehow nostalgic for 2015.

Reading this tiny volume of two short stories by Rainbow Rowell today has made me think that reading a short story or novella is a great way to start my year with some low-stakes, low-choice book reading. A graphic novel could also work.
