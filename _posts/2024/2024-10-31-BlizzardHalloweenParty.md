Here's a photo of my three kids at the Blizzard Halloween party this year in the traditional photo spot in front of the orc statue.
I shot this photo at 1/15s on my Fujifilm X-T5 handheld and I'm really impressed with how it turned out. There's some motion blur where my son is flapping his Ender Dragon "wings", but besides that it's quite sharp. The lens used was the Sigma 18-50mm 2.8 if you're interested in that sort of thing.
