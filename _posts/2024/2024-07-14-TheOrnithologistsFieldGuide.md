**Read:** July 7-14, 2024<br>
**Seasonal Vibe:** Summer<br>
**Travel Location:** England, Paris<br>
**Historical Time:** Victorian Era (but fantasy)<br>
**Spice:** Open door with more euphemistic language (mainly one scene)<br>

This is a truly delightful book, with a perfect blend of magic, humor, romance, and a ‚Äúhistorical‚Äù setting.

I read the [Book of the Month](https://www.mybotm.com/2m2gm3t3xg7) edition.
