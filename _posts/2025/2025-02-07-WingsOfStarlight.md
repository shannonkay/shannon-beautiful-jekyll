My 13-year-old daughter started reading Wings of Starlight immediately and waited anxiously for me to finish it. A romantic YA book prequel to *Secret of the Wings*? We both loved it.

"***Discover the origin of the sweeping, star-crossed romance between the queen of Pixie Hollow and the lord of the Winter Woods.***"

In 2012, when my oldest daughter was a toddler, a new TinkerBell movie came out.  _Secret of the Wings_ was the best one yet, and it featured Lucy Hale as the voice of TinkerBell’s newfound winter sister Periwinkle and Timothy Dalton as the voice of Milori, Lord of Winter.

I watched Secret of the Wings as an adult, and I thought it was good. When I saw the summary for Wings of Starlight, I immediately recognized what it was about before the characters were even named. I was excited! I told my daughter, who was now 13, and preordered it.
