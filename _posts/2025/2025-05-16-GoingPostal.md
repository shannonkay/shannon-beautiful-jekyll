Today I finished reading Going Postal by Terry Pratchett. It was my first Terry Pratchett book.

Here's a quote.

>What kind of man would put a known criminal in charge of a major branch of government? Apart from, say, the average voter.

I look forward to sprinkling more of his books throughout my reading! There are many opinions on the internet about how to go about this. Iâ€™ve even been given this image showing the Discworld series and subseries.
