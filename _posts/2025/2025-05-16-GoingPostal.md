Today I finished reading [Going Postal](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/eff70811-f850-4c2b-a92c-c730bef4fd9b) by [Terry Pratchett](https://terrypratchett.com). It was my first Terry Pratchett book.

Here's a quote.

>What kind of man would put a known criminal in charge of a major branch of government? Apart from, say, the average voter.

I look forward to sprinkling more of his books throughout my reading! There are many opinions on the internet about how to go about this. Iâ€™ve even been given this image showing the Discworld series and subseries.
