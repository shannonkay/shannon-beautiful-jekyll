I met [Louis Sachar](http://www.louissachar.com/) at Barnes & Noble in Huntington Beach, at a signing for his first adult book, [The Magician of Tiger Castle](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/773581/the-magician-of-tiger-castle-by-louis-sachar/). Louis Sachar is also the author of [Holes](https://blog.shannonkay.com/2024/06-05-Holes/). It was a delight to meet him, and hear him discuss his new book.
