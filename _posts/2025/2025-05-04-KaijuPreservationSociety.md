I listened to the audiobook for all of [The Kaiju Preservation Society](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Kaiju-Preservation-Society-Audiobook/B098G33RYH?source_code=ASSGB149080119000H&share_location=pdp) by John Scalzi, and it's a fun sci-fi that's a contrast to most of my other books. It's just weird and imaginative, and there's no romance at all.

I particularly enjoyed the audiobook narrated by [Wil Wheaton](https://wilwheaton.net) for an easy, enjoyable listen. I finished this one while driving home from an event.

This is my second book by [John Scalzi](https://whatever.scalzi.com/about/books-by-john-scalzi/). I liked Starter Villain a bit more, but this one is fun too.
