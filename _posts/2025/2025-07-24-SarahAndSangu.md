I got to see [Sarah Beth Durst](http://www.sarahbethdurst.com) and [Sangu Mandanna](https://sangumandanna.com) at [The Ripped Bodice](https://www.therippedbodice.com/los-angeles) bookstore in LA. Their newest books came out on the same day! It was a delight to see them in conversation together as they talked about their books and writing process for cozy fantasy and romance.

I asked the first question! My question was about the seasonal vibe of their book. I think [The Spellshop](https://blog.shannonkay.com/2024/09-03-TheSpellshop/) was a Summer book, and [The Very Secret Society of Irregular Witches](https://sangumandanna.com/irregular-witches) was a Winter book because of the Winter Solstice. 

Sangu said that if I thought *Secret Society* was Winter, then *A Witch’s Guide to Magical Innkeeping* is **even more winter**. But not, like, Christmas winter. Like grey January winter. 

Sarah said that [The Enchanted Greenhouse](http://www.sarahbethdurst.com/EnchantedGreenhouse.htm) takes place in winter, but each greenhouse is like a little pocket of summer. But that the best time to read her book is whenever you need a little escape.

Here’s a group picture from moderator [Dahlia](https://bio.site/ofpagesandprint)’s Instagram stories.

I zoomed in to see myself better. I’m sitting behind a pink-haired woman.
