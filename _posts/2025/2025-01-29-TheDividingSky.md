[The Dividing Sky](https://www.jilltew.com/the-dividing-sky) sang. It's a dystopian sci-fi adventure, but also had cozy vibe moments, somehow.

The way the dystopian world is set up really makes a statement about our priorities as a society. Highly valued ‚Äúproductive‚Äù workers outsource their emotional needs to a proxy. A proxy can watch a sunrise and share the memory with their client, to ‚Äúsave time‚Äù so that the productivity can continue.¬†

This book has stayed with me. On multiple occasions, things in the real world have reminded me of this book and I had to think ‚Äúwhere was that from?‚Äù before remembering that it was The Dividing Sky.
