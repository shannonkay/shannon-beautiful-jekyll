**Seasonal Vibe:** Summer<br>
**Travel Location:** Seaside island in Georgia<br>
**Historical Time:** Contemporary, with flashbacks<br>
**Read:** April 24-26, 2025<br>
**Format:** Switched between Barnes & Noble special edition hardcover and Audiobook<br>
418 pages | ðŸŽ§ Great audiobook<br>

Great Big Beautiful Life has nice seaside vibes and the romance with the two writers has a great rivals-style tension to it. The stories told by the old woman make it like a dual timeline book with lots of scenes from the past. I enjoyed the character-based mysteries.

Great Big Beautiful Life is Emily Henry's new book for 2025. If you've read her other contemporary romances, I think you'll like this one too. If you haven't read any, they're all standalone books so it's fine to start with the newest.
