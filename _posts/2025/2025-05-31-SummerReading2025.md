Are you looking for something to read this summer? This list is a mix of old and new books that I can happily recommend. Not only do they all exist[^footnote1], but I have read them. They're not all explicitly summer-themed, but I think they would be good for reading in the summer.

This list includes Adult, YA, and Children's(middle grade) books, but I wrote these recommendations with adult readers in mind. If you have a child or teen in your life that would also enjoy the YA or kid lit suggestions, that's a bonus. Maybe you can read them together! 

I get some of my books from my Book of the Month box. If you want to join for $5, [here's my Book of the Month referral link](https://www.mybotm.com/2m2gm3t3xg7). No other affiliate links are used. Links to author websites are used when possible.

### Bonus Picks: 
Series: [Percy Jackson and the Olympians](https://rickriordan.com/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/)<br>

Percy Jackson books are perfect to read or re-read in the summer because most of the books take place in the summer. This is a middle-grade book series that's enjoyable for a wide range of ages. There's also a recent adaptation of the first book on Disney+ with season two premiering December 2025. [Here's my suggested reading order for Percy Jackson books](https://www.shannonkay.com/books/order/percyjackson/index.html).

Non-fiction: [On Tyranny](https://timothysnyder.org/on-tyranny/) by Timothy Snyder

[The Ornithologist's Field Guide to Love](https://www.indiaholton.com/books/the-ornithologists-field-guide-to-love) by [India Holton](https://www.indiaholton.com)<br>
**Travel Location:** England, Paris<br>
**Historical Time:** Victorian Era (but fantasy)<br>

384 pages<br>

[The Ornithologist's Field Guide to Love](https://www.indiaholton.com/books/the-ornithologists-field-guide-to-love) is a truly delightful book, with a perfect blend of magic, humor, romance, and a ‚Äúhistorical‚Äù setting. It takes place in the summer, despite being a Light Academia book.

**Summary**

### The Blue Castle 
![The Blue Castle](https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-WBXd94M/0/NMCjNcPRkgMNsQVf6nbVPk5dTg6VJNNRMPHjX5MxG/X3/i-WBXd94M-X3.jpg)
[The Blue Castle](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL77775W/The_Blue_Castle?edition=key%3A/books/OL35330489M) by [L.M. Montgomery](https://lmmonline.org/)<br>
**Travel Location:** Deerwood, Ontario, Canada (the Muskoka region of Ontario, where Montgomery and her family vacationed for a few weeks during the summer of 1922)<br>
**Historical Time:** 1920's<br>
**First Published:** 1926<br>
**Genres:** Literary, Romance, Social Commentary<br>
250 pages ‚Ä¢ short chapters<br>

[The Blue Castle](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL77775W/The_Blue_Castle?edition=key%3A/books/OL35330489M) has social commentary, humor, tears, romance, and a wonderfully written cast of characters. Plus cats! I think this is as good a classic romance as a Jane Austen book, though it takes place about a hundred years later.¬† 

I've always been a fan of the Anne of Green Gables books, but I hadn't read many of the author's other books. The Blue Castle by L.M. Montgomery was published in 1926 and is one of her few adult novels. The protagonist is 29 years old. 

When I finished reading The Blue Castle for the first time, I felt that I had been altered. I immediately loaned it to my best friend to read. Now I'm telling strangers on the sidewalk(in front of book stores) about it. 

The Blue Castle is in the public domain, so you can get a free ebook at [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/67979) or [Standard Ebooks](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/l-m-montgomery/the-blue-castle).

[The Dividing Sky](https://www.jilltew.com/the-dividing-sky) by [Jill Tew](https://www.jilltew.com)<br>
**Time:** Future (2460)<br>
**Location:** Boston, Massachusetts and New Hampshire<br>
**Genres:** Dystopian, Romance, YA, Sci-Fi<br>
346 pages ‚Ä¢ üéß Good audiobook<br>

[The Dividing Sky](https://www.jilltew.com/the-dividing-sky) sang. It's a dystopian sci-fi adventure, but also had cozy vibe moments, somehow. I'm still thinking about this book, months after reading it. 

**Summary**
> A cunning teen memory merchant falls for the handsome rookie officer on her tail in this swoony dystopian romance.

### Tom Lake

[Tom Lake](https://www.annpatchett.com/tom-lake) by [Ann Patchett](https://www.annpatchett.com)<br>
**Time:** 2020 and 1980's<br>
**Location:** Michigan and New Hampshire<br>
**Genres:** Literary, Dual Timeline, Contemporary, Historical<br>
346 pages ‚Ä¢ üéß Amazing audiobook<br>

[Tom Lake](https://www.annpatchett.com/tom-lake) is a gorgeous summertime literary fiction. I loved the themes of theatre and family. During the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns in 2020, a mother tells her three daughters about her past as an actress while they pick cherries in their family orchard. Most of the stories are about a summer production of Our Town in the 1980‚Äôs, at a theatre company called Tom Lake. And there is a lake!

The audiobook is narrated exquisitely by Meryl Streep.

### A Psalm for the Wild-Built
![A Psalm for the Wild-Built](/assets/img/BookCovers/APsalmfortheWild-Built.jpg)
[A Psalm for the Wild-Built](https://www.otherscribbles.com/#/a-psalm-for-the-wild-built/) by [Becky Chambers](https://www.otherscribbles.com)<br>
**Genres:** Cozy, Sci-Fi, Solarpunk, Novella<br>
151 pages<br>

Cozy Sci-Fi! Serving tea on some moon! An unexpected wild-built robot!

[A Psalm for the Wild-Built](https://www.otherscribbles.com/#/a-psalm-for-the-wild-built/) is gently paced. Leisurely, but doesn‚Äôt feel slow. It's a novella, so it's quite short and a great choice if you don't feel like you can commit to a long book.

### Great Big Beautiful Life

[Great Big Beautiful Life](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/704946/great-big-beautiful-life-reeses-book-club-by-emily-henry/) by [Emily Henry](https://www.emilyhenrybooks.com) <br>
**Travel Location:** Seaside island in Georgia<br>
**Historical Time:** Contemporary, with flashbacks<br>
418 pages ‚Ä¢ üéß Great audiobook<br>

**Summary**
>Two writers compete for the chance to tell the larger-than-life story of a woman with more than a couple of plot twists up her sleeve in this dazzling and sweeping new novel from Emily Henry.

[Great Big Beautiful Life](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/704946/great-big-beautiful-life-reeses-book-club-by-emily-henry/) is a great book to read in the summer. It has nice seaside vibes and the romance with the two writers has a great rivals-style tension to it. The stories told by the old woman make it like a dual timeline book with lots of scenes from the past.  I enjoyed the character-based mysteries.

Great Big Beautiful Life is Emily Henry's new book for 2025. If you've read her other contemporary romances, I think you'll like this one too. If you haven't read any, they're all standalone books so it's fine to start with the newest. If you want to read one of Emily Henry's older books, I suggest Book Lovers.

 **Travel Location:** A cozy seaside town on a magical island<br>
**Genres:** Fantasy, Romance, Cozy, Cottagecore<br>
376 pages<br>

[The Spellshop](http://sarahbethdurst.com/Spellshop.htm) is a delightful cottagecore cozy fantasy. A librarian is hiding spellbooks with her talking plant companion. She makes and sells jam(and spells) on a small island with winged cats. Friendly townsfolk include a baker and a handsome man who takes care of merhorses. There is a romance, but I thought the friendship and found family aspects were more prominent.

### A Wizard of Earthsea
![A Wizard of Earthsea](/assets/img/BookCovers/AWizardofEarthsea.jpg)
[A Wizard of Earthsea](https://www.ursulakleguin.com/a-wizard-of-earthsea) by [Ursula K. LeGuin](https://www.ursulakleguin.com)<br>
**First Published:** 1968<br>
**Genres:** Fantasy, Classic<br>
183 pages<br>

[A Wizard of Earthsea](https://www.ursulakleguin.com/a-wizard-of-earthsea) is a fantasy classic first published in 1968. Short but impactful, this book is credited with being the first book with a "wizard school" in it. 

I loved the themes of loving people in non-romantic ways like friendship and mentorship. We might call that "found family" now. This book also resists violence and militaristic solutions to problems.

**Summary**
>Ged, the greatest sorcerer in all Earthsea, was called Sparrowhawk in his reckless youth.¬†  
>  
Hungry for power and knowledge, Sparrowhawk tampered with long-held secrets and loosed a terrible shadow upon the world. This is the tale of his testing, how he mastered the mighty words of power, tamed an ancient dragon, and crossed death's threshold to restore the balance.

352 pages ‚Ä¢ Short Chapters ‚Ä¢ üéß Great Audiobook<br>

[Good Dirt](https://charmspen.com/good-dirt/) deals with serious topics, but is hopeful and easy to read. The ‚Äúgood dirt‚Äù was in relation to literally the land where you live, but also clay for making pottery. I enjoyed the stories of each ancestor, as well as the contemporary storyline which was a story about figuring out who you are as an adult. The chapters were short, making it easy to read ‚Äújust one more chapter‚Äù.¬†

### Holes
![Holes book cover](/assets/img/BookCovers/Holes.jpg)
[Holes](https://www.rhcbooks.com/books/159528/holes-by-louis-sachar) by [Louis Sachar](http://www.louissachar.com)
233 pages<br>

[Holes](https://www.rhcbooks.com/books/159528/holes-by-louis-sachar) is a really wonderful book. It touches on so many important themes in really accessible ways. It‚Äôs easy to read, but still compelling. I love the way everything works together in each character‚Äôs backstory for a really satisfying connection. 

This book has dual timelines, mystery, humor, found family, and even a historical romance in it. It's a good pick for summer reading, because it's about camp!

Is this technically a children's book? Yes. I read it for the first time when my sixth grade daughter had it assigned for class. I remembered liking the movie, but had never read the book, so I decided to read it with her. This is a great book whether you're a kid or an adult. (If you do have kids you want to read it with, I'd recommend it for about age 10 and up.)

**Summary**
> Stanley Yelnats is under a curse. A curse that began with his no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather and has since followed generations of Yelnats. Now Stanley has been unjustly sent to a boys' detention center, Camp Green Lake, where the warden makes the boys "build character" by spending all day, every day, digging five feet wide and five feet deep. It doesn't take long for Stanley to realize there's more than character improvement going on at Camp Green Lake. The boys are digging holes because the warden is looking for something. Stanley tries to dig up the truth in this inventive and darkly humorous tale of crime and punishment‚Äîand redemption.
