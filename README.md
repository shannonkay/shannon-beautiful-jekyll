This project is my personal blog. I forked [Beautiful Jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) for my blog, because the theme was closer to what I wanted than the Minima theme that is the current default for Jekyll. I went looking for a new theme, and Beautiful Jekyll looked like a good fit. For full documentation, please check out the main [Beautiful Jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) project.

In case it's of interest or help to anyone, you're welcome to check out and copy bits of my CSS and other code modifications. Just don't take my posts and photos. Thanks. ðŸ¦„

## Modifications

- Pink styling to my taste. Most of this is in the shannon.css file
- Category specific pages for my categories of Books, Journal, and Tech
- Extra metadata on the posts pages for adding optional weather and mood information
- Made a dedicated RSS feed for the "Books" category (bookfeed.xml)

## Notes
- I'm deploying to Netlify
- My blog is currently located at [blog.shannonkay.me](https://blog.shannonkay.me)
